### Keeping Notes

## Description

Keeping Notes is an application ran with express.js on the backend to create and render important Notes for you day-to-day activities. It can be utilized as a reminder or a basic task compiler. You will utilize the right-hand column to enter a title and notes for the tile and then you will click the top right floppy disk to save the note. The note will then appear on the left hand column where you can delete it using the red garbage button. The notes are saved into a database and can be retrieved in JSON. The + at the top right clears the right hand column and allows a new note to be written in. Enjoy!
